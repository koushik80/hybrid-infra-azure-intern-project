<h1 align="center">IT System Specialist Internship Project</h1>
<h3 align="left">Abstract: :speech_balloon:</h3>

<p align="left">The assignment required creating a UI by using a backend service for displaying data from journeys made with city bikes in the Helsinki Capital Area. The backend is allowed to use a DB, or it can be memory-based. I preferred to use MongoDB as the memory-based will be quite slow and gave priority to building and running the application smoothly to display the data to the end-to-end users.

During this application development, I decided to use Redux for state management, studied it's documentation deeply and implemented it. I observed how it behaves consistently across client, server, and native environments. The state of my application is kept in a store, and each component can access any state that it needs from this store. I used Redux with my React application to maintain and update data across application for multiple components to share, all while remaining independent of the components.
