<h1 align="center">IT System Specialist Internship Project</h1>
<h3 align="left">Abstract: :speech_balloon:</h3>

<p align="left">Welcome to the IT System Specialist Internship Project! This hands-on opportunity is designed to provide me with real-world experience in managing and maintaining a variety of technologies essential to modern IT infrastructure. As an intern in this project, I will have the chance to work with a wide range of tools and platforms, contributing to the setup, configuration, and management of critical systems.

During this application development, I decided to use Redux for state management, studied it's documentation deeply and implemented it. I observed how it behaves consistently across client, server, and native environments. The state of my application is kept in a store, and each component can access any state that it needs from this store. I used Redux with my React application to maintain and update data across application for multiple components to share, all while remaining independent of the components.
