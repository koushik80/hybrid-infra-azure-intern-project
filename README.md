For my internship project, I have chosen to explore multiple domains and engage with various approaches to the **IT** environment. I aim to address challenges presented by new technologies, covering aspects such as configuration, diagnostics, monitoring, security, risk management, and end-user support.

Mapping and describing the IT operating environment within a hybrid IT setup involves documenting the diverse components, systems, and processes that constitute an organization's IT infrastructure. A hybrid IT environment typically combines on-premises infrastructure with cloud-based services. Here is a step-by-step process for mapping and describing the hybrid IT operating environment:

**1. Identify Key Stakeholders:**

  - Begin by determining the key stakeholders who should participate in the mapping and description process, including IT administrators, system architects, and business stakeholders.

**2. Gather Information:**

  - Collect comprehensive information about your IT environment, encompassing on-premises hardware, software, networking components, and cloud services. Additionally, consider data centers, server rooms, and remote locations.

**3. Create an Inventory:**

:chart: ` Develop a comprehensive inventory list that includes: `

` Hardware: ` Servers, storage devices, networking equipment, workstations, laptops, mobile devices, etc.

` Software: ` Operating systems, applications, databases, and middleware.

` Network: ` Routers, switches, firewalls, load balancers, VPNs, and other network components.

` Cloud Services: ` Enumerate all the cloud services in use, such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or specific SaaS applications.

` Data: ` Identify where data is stored, whether on-premises or in the cloud.

**4. Define Relationships:**

 -	As a System Expert, ascertain how these components and services are interconnected and detail the flow of data and information between them. This may involve creating network diagrams, data flow diagrams, and noting integration points.

**5. Document Dependencies:**

 -	Identify dependencies between different components and services. For instance, determine which applications rely on specific databases or cloud services.

**6. Security and Compliance:**

 -	Evaluate the security measures in place, including firewalls, encryption, access controls, and authentication methods. Additionally, specify any compliance requirements relevant to your industry or organization.

**7. Performance Metrics:**

 -	Include information about performance monitoring tools and processes, describing how to monitor the health and performance of your IT environment and how to respond to issues.

**8. Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity:**

 -	Explain disaster recovery and business continuity strategies, and provide details about backup processes, recovery points, and failover procedures.

**9. Scalability and Growth:**

 -	Discuss how the IT environment can scale to accommodate growth or changes in demand, which might involve cloud auto-scaling or hardware upgrades.

**10. Vendor and Service Contracts:**

 -	List contracts and service-level agreements (SLAs) with third-party vendors, cloud providers, and software providers. Include contact information and renewal dates.

**11. Diagrams and Visuals:**

 -	Create diagrams, flowcharts, or visual representations of the hybrid IT environment to facilitate understanding for stakeholders.

**12. Documentation Repository:**

 -	Establish a central repository for all this information, such as a document management system or a wiki. Ensure regular updates are made.

**13. Review and Validation:**

 -	Share the documentation with relevant stakeholders for review and validation, ensuring it accurately represents the current state of the hybrid IT environment.

**14. Maintenance and Updates:**

 -	Recognize that IT environments evolve over time, necessitating the establishment of a process for regular reviews and updates to keep the documentation current.

**15. Disaster Recovery and Incident Response Plans:**

 - While not part of the mapping and description process, it is crucial to document disaster recovery and incident response plans separately from the general environment documentation.

Creating a mapping and description of the hybrid IT operating environment is an ongoing, collaborative effort among IT teams and stakeholders. Maintaining up-to-date documentation is essential for effective IT management and decision-making.

<h3 align="left">Migration :twisted_rightwards_arrows:</h3>

<p align="left">

I migrated my on-premises **Hyper-V** environment to Azure using the **Azure Migrate service**. This service simplifies migration, modernization, and optimization, including discovery, assessments, and right-sizing for infrastructure, data, and applications. It supports third-party tool integration.

The **Migration** and **Modernization tool** offers agentless replication for **Hyper-V VMs** without needing any installation on the VMs themselves. This tool is specifically optimized for **Hyper-V migration**.

Additionally, **Azure** provides **Site Recovery** for disaster recovery purposes, sharing some technology components with the Migration and Modernization tool but serving different use cases.
</p>

<h3 align="left">Architecture :wrench: </h3>

 - I installed the **Microsoft Azure Site Recovery provider** on **Hyper-V hosts** and registered it with the **Migration tool**.

 - The provider handles replication for **Hyper-V VMs**, while the **Azure Recovery Service agent** manages data replication to **Azure**.

 - Replicated data was stored in an **Azure subscription storage account**.

 - The Migration tool processed the replicated data and applies it to replica disks for creating **Azure VMs**.

 - I installed the necessary components from a single setup file provided by the **Migration tool**.

 - The provider and appliance establish secure, encrypted outbound **HTTPS** connections on port **443** to communicate with the **Migration tool**.

<h3 align="left">Technical Procedures: </h3>


 - I set up an Azure Host VM in the Azure Portal with a VNET and two NICs.

 - Then, I established an Azure Bastion for secure access to Azure VMs without public endpoints and protection against brute force exploits targeting OS credentials. Additionally, I added a subnet to the VNET used for the Host VM.

 - Afterwards, I initiated the Host VM with Bastion connectivity and created two folders, "D:\VHDs" and "D:\VMs," within it. I downloaded the Windows Server 2022 VHD file from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2022">Windows Server Evaluations</a> and placed it in the "D:\VHDs" folder.

 - Using Hyper-V Manager, I created a new VM, specifying "D:\VMs" as the location and connecting it to "D:\VHDs." I renamed the new VM to HDC1.

 - In the next phase, I set up an Azure Migrate project in the Azure Portal. For this project, I configured a VNET called "mig-vnet" with an individual IP address and subnet. Additionally, I created another VNET named "test-vnet" with an IP address and subnet.

 - Lastly, I established a standard LRS (Locally Redundant Storage) account named "migstore80" in the Azure Portal.

` Deploy and configure the Azure Migrate appliance `

 - In Azure Portal, go to **Azure Migrate | Get Started**, and selected **"Discover, assess, and migrate"** under **Servers, databases, and web apps**.

 - On the **Azure Migrate | Servers, databases, and web apps page**, choose **"Discover"** in the **Azure Migrate: Discovery and Assessment** section.

 - Ensure **"Discover using the appliance"** is selected and verified that my server is virtualized with **Hyper-V**.

 - Entered a name of my appliance (e.g., HDC1) and clicked **"Generate Key"** in the **Discover** page.

 - Selected the ".VHD file" option in the **"Download Azure Migrate appliance"** textbox and saved it to the D:\VMs folder.

 - After the download, extracted the content of the ZIP file into the D:\VMs folder.

 - In **Hyper-V Manager**, selected my VMs (e.g., WKS1 and WKS2), and choose **"Import Virtual Machine"** to start the wizard.

 - Started the newly imported VM in **Hyper-V Manager** and ensured it's running and connected.

 - Accepted the License terms in the VM connection window.

 - Set the password for the built-in Administrator account in the VM connection window's Customize settings page and clicked **"Finish."**

 - In the **Appliance Configuration Manager**, add credentials with **Friendly Name, User Name, and Password**.

 - In the **Appliance Configuration Manager's** Provide **Hyper-V host/cluster details** section, selected **"Add discovery source"** Choose **"Hyper-V Host/Cluster"** in the **Discovery** source dropdown, and specified the **IP address/FQDN** and saved settings.

 - Enabled the **"Disable the slider if you don't want to perform these features"** toggle and started the discovery.

 ` Configure, Run and View Assessment `

 - Went back to **Azure Migrate | Servers, databases, and web apps** in the **Azure portal**, clicked **"Refresh,"** and selected **"Assess"** under **Azure Migrate: Discovery and Assessment**. Choose "Azure VM" in the dropdown.

 - Specified necessary settings on the **Assessment settings** page and saved them.

 - In the **Migration and Modernization** section, selected **"Discover"** and configure the necessary settings.

 - On the **Discover** page, under **"Prepare Hyper-V host servers,"** downloaded the **Hyper-V replication provider software installer** by clicking the first **"Download"** link.

 - Once the download completed, opened the file to start the **Azure Site Recovery Provider Setup (Hyper-V server) wizard** and installed it.

 - From the **Discover Machines** page, downloaded the registration key.

 - In the **Provider installation** page of the **Azure Site Recovery Provider Setup (Hyper-V server)** wizard, selected **"Register"** to begin the **Microsoft Azure Site Recovery Registration Wizard**. Followed the steps to set up the Vault, and completed the installation wizard.

 - Refreshed the browser window and it's redirected to **Azure Migrate | Servers, databases and web apps** page. On the **Azure Migrate | Servers, databases and web apps** page, in the **Migration and modernization** section, selected the **Discover** link and then selected **Finalize**.

` Configure Replication of Hyper-V VM `

 - Once the registration was finalized, browsed back to the **Azure Migrate | Servers, databases and web apps** page and then, in the **Migration and modernization** section, selected the **Replicate** link.
 - On the Basics tab of the Replicate page, in the **"Are your machines virtualized?"** drop-down list, selected **Yes**, with **Hyper-V** and then selected **Next**.
 - On the Virtual Machines tab of the **Replicate** page, specified the necessary settings(selected WKS1 & WKS2) and selected **Next**.
 - On the Target settings tab of the **Replicate** page, specified the necessary settings(selected mig-vnet) and selected Next.
 - On the **Compute** tab of the **Replicate** page, ensured that the **Standard_D2s_v3** is selected in the Azure VM Size drop-down list. In the **OS Type** drop-down list, selected **Windows** and then selected **Next**.
 - On the **Disks** tab of the **Replicate** page, accepted the default settings and selected **Next**.
 - On the **Tags** tab of the **Replicate** page, accepted the default settings and selected **Next**.
 - On the **Review + Start** replication tab of the **Replicate** page, selected **Replicate**.
 - To monitor the status of replication, back on the **Azure Migrate | Servers, databases and web apps** page, selected **Refresh** and then, in the **Migration and modernization** section, selected the **Replicating servers entry**. On the **Migration and modernization | Replicating machines** page, examineed the **Status** column in the list of the replicating machines.
 - After 15 minutes the status changed as **Protected**.

` Perform Migration of Hyper-V VM`

 - On the **HDC1** VM page, selected **Test migration**.
 - On the **Test migration** page, in the Virtual network drop-down list, select **test-vnet** and then selected Test migration.
 - On the Azure portal, in the Search resources, services, and docs text box, on the toolbar, search for and selected Virtual machines and then, on the Virtual machines page, noted the entry representing the newly replicated virtual machine **WKS1** and **WKS2**.
 - On the Azure portal, browse back to the **Migration and modernization | Replicating machines** page, selected **Refresh**, and then verified that the  **WKS1** and **WKS2** vms virtual machines are listed with the Cleanup test failover pending status.
 - On the **Migration and modernization | Replicating machines** page, selected the entry representing the WKS1 and WKS2 virtual machines.
 - On the WKS1 and WKS2 replicating machines page, selected Clean up test migration.
 - On the Test migrate cleanup page, selected the checkbox Testing is complete. Delete test virtual machine and then selected Cleanup Test.
 - Once the test failover cleanup job completed, refreshed the browser page displaying the WKS1 and WKS2 replicating machines page and noted that the Migrate icon in the toolbar automatically became available.
 - On the Migrate page, selected Yes  to Shutdown virtual machines and perform a planned migration with no data loss? drop-down list, and then selected Migrate.
 - To monitor the status of migration, browsed back to the Azure Migrate | Servers, databases and web apps page. In the Migration and modernization section, selected the Replicating servers entry and then, on the Migration and modernization | Replicating machines page, examined the Status column in the list of the replicating machines. Also verified that the status displayed the Planned failover finished status.


<h3 align="left">Replication Process :arrows_counterclockwise:</h3>

 - When I enabled replication for a Hyper-V VM, initial replication began.
 - A Hyper-V VM snapshot was taken.
 - VHDs on the VM are replicated one-by-one until they are all copied to Azure. Initial replication time depended on the VM size and network bandwidth.
 - Disk changes that occurred during initial replication are tracked using Hyper-V Replica, and stored in log files (hrl files).
      - Log files are in the same folder as the disks.
      - Each disk-associated hrl file that's sent to secondary storage.
      - The snapshot and log files consumed disk resources while initial replication was in progress.
 - After the initial replication was finished, the VM snapshot was deleted, and delta replication began.
 - Incremental disk changes were tracked in hrl files. Replication logs were periodically uploaded to an Azure storage account by the Recovery Services agent.

<h3 align="left">Customer Expectations: :information_desk_person:</h3>

<p align="left">

Clients can expect a secure, efficient, and highly available environment that seamlessly integrates on-premises and cloud resources. Regular maintenance, updates, and monitoring ensure optimal performance and proactive communication keeps users informed during exceptional situations.
</p>

<h3 align="left">Future Possibilities: :seedling: </h3>

<p align="left">

My project sets the stage for future enhancements, including the expansion of **Azure services, optimization of workloads, and continuous improvement of security measures**. Additionally, the project can serve as a foundation for future cloud-based initiatives, such as **AI** and **Machine Learning** implementations, further enhancing customer experiences.

In summary, in this project I have successfully implemented a hybrid cloud environment, aligning with **ITIL** principles, to deliver a reliable, secure, and scalable infrastructure. The integration of **on-premises** and **Azure resources** provides a robust foundation for current and future **IT** initiatives, ensuring ongoing value for any organization and its users.
